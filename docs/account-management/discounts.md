# Discounts

At Semaphore, we offer discounts for students, non-profit organizations, and educators, researchers, and fellows involved in computer science/programming education or research.

## Non-profit discounts

For non-profit organizations, we offer a 25% discount. This means that at the end of each monthly billing cycle your total bill will be discounted by 25%.

If you are eligible for this discount, all you need to do is email us at [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com) and provide proof of your organization's status, e.g. an IRS determination letter for US based companies (or its equivalent in other countries).

## Free student accounts

Every student currently enrolled at in accredited high school, college, or university, as well as any learn-to-code program or bootcamp, is eligible for a student account.

Aside from the regular $10 in free credit per month, students will receive an additional $120 in gift credits each year, for as long as their studies last.
Students can build projects with 1 [e1-standard-2 machine](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/machine-types/#linux-machine-types) and 1 [a1-standard-4 machine](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/machine-types/#apple-machine-type).

In order to request a student account, please send an email to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com) from your school-issued email address. In the event that you don’t have one, please provide some sort of document that verifies your status as a student. 

## Free educator accounts

Individual educators teaching computer science or programming at accredited high schools, colleges, or universities — as well as any learn-to-code programs or bootcamps — are eligible for a free account.

Aside from the regular $10 in free credit per month, educators get a certain amount of free credit per year, depending on their status.
Educators have 4 [e1-standard-2 machines](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/machine-types/) and 1 [a1-standard-4 machine](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/machine-types/#apple-machine-type) at their disposal.

In order to request an educator account, please send an email to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com) from your .edu email address and/or a document that verifies your status as an educator.

## Research discounts

Researchers or collaborators/fellows working on a project at an accredited institution whose purpose is related to learning, teaching (even if they are not directly be involved in the teaching process), and/or training computer science or programming are eligible for a discount.

To request a research discount, please send an email to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com) from your .edu email address and/or a document that verifies your status.
