# Plans

With Semaphore 2.0 you only pay for what you use and you can customize
your usage according to your team's needs. See more about Semaphore 2.0 plans below.

## Trial period

The trial period lasts for 14 days. During the trial period, you can use
[the default machine quota](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/quotas-and-limits/)
completely free of charge. 

Of course, you can easily scale up if you need a larger capacity by going to
**Billing > Request a quota increase** or by reaching
out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com)
(please include which type of machine you prefer).

**Note:** If you currently have an annual subscription to Semaphore Classic and
would like to migrate to 2.0, please reach out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).

## Paid plan

The paid plan is activated once you add your credit card information. You will be
charged based on your usage for the previous month at the beginning of each month. 
Billing cycles are based on calendar months.

You can find the default number of machines for paid plans on the [Quotas and
Limits page](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/quotas-and-limits/).
If you need to scale up, you can easily do so by going to
**Billing > Request a quota increase** or by reaching
out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com)
(please include which type of machine you prefer).

In Semaphore 2.0, all organizations are on monthly plans. You may have as many
organizations as you like.

**Note:** If you are building open source projects on a paid plan, you will be 
charged according to our [pricing page](https://semaphoreci.com/pricing) for these
builds as well. Open source projects can be built free of charge only on an [open source
plan](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/account-management/plans/#open-source-plan).

## Open source plan

Under this plan, you have unlimited build minutes for building your public
repositories completely free of charge. You also have [four e1-standard-2 machines 
and one a1-standard-4 machine](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/machine-types/) at your disposal.

You (an owner) can only have a single organization on an open source plan at any given time.

**Note:** Open source projects can be built free of charge only on an open source
plan. If you are building open source projects on a [paid plan](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/account-management/plans/#paid-plan), you will be charged according to our [pricing page](https://semaphoreci.com/pricing)
for these builds.

## Free plan

The free plan includes $10 (up to 1,300 build minutes) of free credit per calendar 
month. At the beginning of each month, you will receive a new $10 credit for your
organization. On this plan, you will be able to run 1 job at a time and you can 
use [e1-standard-2 machines and a1-standard-4 machines](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/machine-types/).

You can only have a single organization on a free plan at any given time.

## Grandfathered plans for Semaphore Classic users

If your organization is on a paid plan on Semaphore Classic, you are eligible for 
a Grandfathered plan on Semaphore 2.0. Under this plan, we match your Semaphore Classic 
costs and capacity so you can use Semaphore 2.0 at the same monthly price. 

If you are interested in this plan, please reach out to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).

## Upgrading to a paid plan

If you'd like to upgrade to a paid plan, you can do that from the Billing page of
your organization. All you need to do is enter your payment information.
