You can change or remove any budget you set at any time.

## Changing billing information

If you want to change recipient name, company name, address, phone number,
billing email, VAT ID, or country on the invoice, please contact us at
[support@semaphoreci.com](mailto:support@semaphoreci.com).

## Changing VAT number

After a subscription has been purchased, it is not possible to add or change
VAT number (VAT ID) from the UI. If you wish to change the VAT number associated 
with your subscription, please reach out to [support@semaphoreci.com](mailto:support@semaphoreci.com), 
with the VAT number you want to add and we will gladly make it happen.

## Invoices

You will receive an invoice for your organization at the end of each billing
period. This invoice will be sent to the email address you entered when you 
added your payment info.

You can also find your invoices at the bottom of the Plans & Billing page.

## Refunds

Apart from cases of extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days 
in a month), we do not offer refunds. We will, however, consider requests for refunds in 
extenuating circumstances. If you would like to request a refund, please email us at 
[billing@semaphoreci.com](mailto:billing@semaphoreci.com) and our team will do what we 
can to work out a solution. Please include the affected Workflow ID when contacting our
