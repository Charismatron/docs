# Getting Started

This guide will have you running a successful CI/CD pipeline on Semaphore in
minutes.

## About Semaphore

Semaphore is a cloud-based automation service for building, testing and
deploying software.

Semaphore is **built for developer productivity**, guided by three principles:

1. **Speed**: Developers must work in a fast feedback loop, so CI/CD workflows
   must be fast.
3. **Power**: The CI/CD tool needs to be able to run any automated software
   workflow, at any scale.
2. **Ease of use**: CI/CD must be easy enough for every developer to use, so
   that they are in close contact with the operation of their software and its
   impact on users.

The rest of this guide will walk you through the first steps of using Semaphore.
