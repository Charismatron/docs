# Getting Started

This tutorial will have you running a CI/CD pipeline on Semaphore in minutes.

The tutorial assumes that you have a free [Semaphore account][semaphore-home].


## About Semaphore

Semaphore is a cloud-based automation service for building, testing and
deploying software.

Developers use Semaphore to implement continuous integration (CI) and continuous
delivery (CD) pipelines, which help get software from version control to end
users in a safe and automated way.

Semaphore is **built for developer productivity**, guided by three principles:

1. **Speed**: Developers must work in a fast feedback loop, so CI/CD workflows
   must be fast.
3. **Power**: The CI/CD tool needs to be able to run any automated software
   workflow, at any scale.
2. **Ease of use**: CI/CD must be easy enough for every developer to use, so
   that they are in close contact with the operation of their software and its
   impact on users.

As a result, Semaphore is typically used by engineering teams that optimize for
getting things done.

The rest of this guide will walk you through the first steps of using Semaphore.
